Since Github's release tool doesn't support history, we've added this directory to copy paste releases in case one has substantial changes to make to a release. 

Just create a PR where you propose changes to a release by adding a new .md file, and discuss. When it's merged, just copy paste in the release tool.

Of course, it's not mandatory if you are the sole contributor to the release, just use Github's editor. 

Why do we keep using the tool, then, since we alread expose releases through nosgestesclimat.fr/nouveaut√©s ? 

Because it's good practice to have the Github release tab full and up to date. But we could also just reference our URL instead. To be discussed.
